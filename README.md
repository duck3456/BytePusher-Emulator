# BytePusher-Emulator
A simple [BytePusher](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher) VM implementation written in JavaScript. Audio isn't supported yet. Go to [https://duck3456.github.io/BytePusher-Emulator](https://duck3456.github.io/BytePusher-Emulator) to try it out!

Note: It works slower than other BytePusher emulators.
